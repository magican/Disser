abstract = {SAR spacebome capability to detect marine oil spills through damping of wind-generated short gravity-capillary waves has been extensively demonstrated during past years. In contrast, it has not yet been found the optimal use of optical/NIR imaging sensors for detection and monitoring of polluted areas. We propose the use of Modis images acquired in sun glint conditions to reveal smoothed regions such as those affected by oil pollution. The underlying physical mechanism is based on the modification of the surface slopes distribution composing the roughened sea due to the action of mineral oils. The methodology is demonstrated for selected case studies in the Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic where spills were detected by ERS SAR imaging. The corresponding Modis images acquired within a few hours were under sun glint conditions according to satellite imaging geometry and wind field distribution over the selected areas. Results of a detailed study about the effective applicability of the method is discussed. The importance of these results are based on the possible extensive exploitation of combined Modis and SAR data in view of the high repetitive coverage (about two times a day).},

abstract = {A two-scale model of rough surfaces is considered which permits theoretical interpretation of the features of very high frequency (VHF) scattering from such surfaces (say, from a sea surface). The scattering surface is assumed to be a superposition of small-scale ripple and large waves (swell). Reflection from the latter may he considered by the Kirchhoff approximation. The spatial spectrum of corrugations is taken into consideration; the calculations based on this model help to give an explanation of the behavior of the scattered intensity as a function of the angle of incidencepsi, and to establish which factors affect this dependence at various values ofpsi- Theoretically predicted dependence of the scattered intensity upon radio wavelengthlambda, depolarization of the scattered signal, and other features of the scattered radiation are in good agreement with the experimental data obtained from direct measurements. Frequency spectra of the backscattered signal were also investigated (experimental measurements were carried out at wavelengths 3.2 cm, 10 cm, 50 cm, 1.5 m, and 4 m). Observed shifts of the central frequency agree with results of other authors (for the range oflambda = 3cm to 200 m). The measured values of the spectrum width appeared approximately twice those theoretically calculated. This may be explained by the influence of dissipative processes and of fluctuations of the skin-deep layer drift velocities. Space correlation of the backscattered signal was also investigated (both theoretically and experimentally). 50 percent decorrelation occurs at distances compared with dimensions of a wave slope.},

The Shuttle Imaging Radar-A acquired images over a variety of regions around the world with an imaging geometry different from the one used by the Seasat SAR. The spaceborne SAR principle is discussed, taking into account ambiguities, orbital and environmental factors, range curvature and range walk, surface interaction mechanisms, thermal and speckle noise, key tradeoff parameters, and nonconventional SAR systems. Attention is also given to spaceborne SAR sensors, the digital processing of spaceborne SAR data, the optical processing of spaceborne SAR data, postimage formation processing, data interpretation techniques and applications, and the next decade.},

Synchronous measurements are made for the wind wave spectrum variability (in the wavelength range 1.6-50 cm), the sea surface tension coefficient, internal waves and wind velocity. Histograms of surface tension in slicks are constructed and it is concluded that slicks associated with surfactant films predominate. The relative areas of slicks and the spectral contrasts of wind waves are measured. Film slicks above a solitary and a quasiperiodic internal wave as well as those in the field of a monotonic and an oscillating wind front are recorded for the first time. A theoretical analysis is given for the surfactant distribution in the field of inhomogeneous surface flows and for the wind wave spectrum transformation, taking into account the film effect on ripple damping and the kinematic effects of flow action on surface waves. Good agreement is obtained between the model calculations of spectrum transformation and the observational data. The possibility of film elasticity restoration by the spectral contrasts of wind ripples in slicks is demonstrated.},

abstract = {During the two SIR-C/X-SAR missions in 1994, surface film experiments were performed in the North Sea with a 5-frequency/multipolarization scatterometer flown on a helicopter, in order to investigate the reduction of the radar backscatter in the presence of quasibiogenic and anthropogenic sea surface films, particularly, at different wind speeds. Under all wind conditions encountered in this study, the measured damping ratio (i.e., the ratio of the radar backscatter from a slick-free and a slick-covered water surface) increases with increasing Bragg wavenumber. It is shown that not only Marangoni damping theory, but also wind-induced effects, primarily the energy input by the wind into the wave spectrum, also have to be taken into account. The reductions measured at low to moderate wind speeds (3.5–4 m/s and 5 m/s) are qualitatively explained by means of a comparison of the different source terms of the action balance equation. For the case of high wind speed (12 m/s) a theoretical model for the damping ratios is developed. Using this model, the experimental data can well be reproduced, and the absence of the Marangoni damping maximum at intermediate Bragg wavenumbers (approximately 100 rad/m) can be interpreted. Furthermore, the model can explain the similarities between the radar backscatter reductions measured over quasibiogenic and anthropogenic surface films under high wind conditions.},

abstract = {Results from the analyses of several spaceborne imaging radar-C/X-band synthetic aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) images are presented, which were acquired during the two SIR-C/X-SAR missions in April and October 1994 by the L-, C-, and X-band multipolarization SAR aboard the space shuttle Endeavour. The images showing natural (biogenic) surface slicks as well as man-made (anthropogenic) mineral oil spills were analyzed with the aim to study whether or not active radar techniques can be applied to discriminating between these two kinds of surface films. Controlled slick experiments were carried out during both shuttle missions in the German Bight of the North Sea as well as in the northern part of the Sea of Japan and the Kuroshio Stream region, where surface films of different viscoelastic properties were deployed within the swath of the shuttle radars. The results show that the damping behavior of the same substance is strongly dependent on wind speed. At high wind speed (8–12 m/s) the ratio of the radar backscatter from a slick-free and a slick-covered water surface (damping ratio) is smaller than at low to moderate wind speeds (4–7 m/s). At 12 m/s, only slight differences in the damping behavior of different substances were measured by SIR-C/X-SAR. Furthermore, several SAR scenes from various parts of the world's oceans showing radar signatures of biogenic as well as anthropogenic surface films at low to moderate wind speeds are analyzed. The damping behavior of these different kinds of oceanic surface films varies particularly at Lband where the biogenic surface films exhibit larger damping characteristics. Results of polarimetric studies from multipolarization SAR images showing various surface films are presented. It can be delineated from these results that Bragg scattering as well as specular reflection contribute to the backscattered radar signal at low incidence angles (up to 30°). It is concluded that at low to moderate wind speeds, multifrequency radar techniques seem to be capable of discriminating between the different surface films, whereas at high wind conditions a discrimination seems to be difficult.},

There is a formal resemblance to two-dimensional flow, with surface temperature playing the role of vorticity, but a different relationship between the flow and the advected scalar creates several distinctive features. A series of examples are described which highlight some of these features: the evolution of an elliptical vortex; the start-up vortex shed by flow over a mountain; the instability of temperature filaments; the 'edge wave' critical layer; and mixing in an overturning edge wave. Characteristics of the direct cascade of the tracer variance to small scales in homogeneous turbulence, as well as the inverse energy cascade, are also described. In addition to its geophysical relevance, the ubiquitous generation of secondary instabilities and the possibility of finite-time collapse make this system a potentially important, numerically tractable, testbed for turbulence theories.},

abstract = {The ability to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of the ocean by an effective version of Surface Quasi-Geostrophy (eSQG) is examined. Using the fact that surface density plays an analogous role as interior potential vorticity (PV), the eSQG method consists in inverting the QG PV generated by sea-surface density only. We also make the extra assumption that sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies fully represent surface density anomalies. This approach requires a single snapshot of SST and the setup of two parameters: the mean Brunt-Vaisala frequency and a parameter that determines the energy level at the ocean surface. The validity of this approach is tested using an Ocean General Circulation Model simulation representing the North Atlantic in winter. It is shown that the method is quite successful in reconstructing the velocity field at the ocean surface for mesoscales (between 30 and 300 km). The eSQG framework can also be applied to reconstruct subsurface fields using surface information. Results show that the reconstruction of velocities and vorticity from surface fields is reasonably good for the upper 500 m and that the success of the method mainly depends on the quality of the SST as a proxy of the density anomaly at the base of the mixed layer. This situation happens after a mixed-layer deepening period. Therefore the ideal situation for the application of this method would be after strong wind events.},

abstract = {This study examines the emergence and evolution of a mesoscale sea surface temperature (SST) variability induced by a uniform and impulsive wind stress when an embedding quasigeostrophic (QG) flow is present. The SST variability which is triggered by the mixed-layer deepening closely resembles some characteristic properties of the QG flow, namely either the subsurface temperature or relative vorticity, depending on the amplitude of the deepening. The SST variance can have the same order of magnitude as the subsurface temperature variance. Within 10 days, the SST field, which is stirred only by the horizontal QG flow, displays a rapid spectral evolution characterized by the emergence of small-scale structures and the appearance of thermal fronts located in the QG jet areas. This evolution depends only on the deformation of the large-scale structures of the SST field, initially resulting from the mixed-layer deepening, by the QG strain field. In contrast with SST, later evolution of the mixed-layer depth is characterized by the emergence of large-scale structures. From these dynamical results, it is speculated that, when nonuniform initial conditions are considered, the resulting SST spatial variability should be more closely related to the subsurface temperature and the SST variance could be significantly increased.},

abstract = {In this study, the relation between the interior and the surface dynamics for nonlinear baroclinically unstable flows is examined using the concepts of potential vorticity. First, it is demonstrated that baroclinic unstable flows present the property that the potential vorticity mesoscale and submesoscale anomalies in the ocean interior are strongly correlated to the surface density anomalies. Then, using the invertibility of potential vorticity, the dynamics are decomposed in terms of a solution forced by the three-dimensional (3D) potential vorticity and a solution forced by the surface boundary condition in density. It is found that, in the upper oceanic layers, the balanced flow induced only by potential vorticity is strongly anticorrelated with that induced only by the surface density with a dominance of the latter. The major consequence is that the 3D balanced motions can be determined from only the surface density and the characteristics of the basin-scale stratification by solving an elliptic equation. These properties allow for the possibility to reconstruct the 3D balanced velocity field of the upper layers from just the knowledge of the surface density by using a simpler model, that is, an "effective" surface quasigeostrophic model. All these results are validated through the examination of a primitive equation simulation reproducing the dynamics of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.},

@article{Tomiyasu1978,
abstract = {A synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can produce high-resolution two-dimensional images of mapped areas. The SAR comprises a pulsed transmitter, an antenna, and a phase-coherent receiver. The SAR is borne by a constant velocity vehicle such as an aircraft or satellite, with the antenna beam axis oriented obliquely to the velocity vector. The image plane is defined by the velocity vector and antenna beam axis. The image orthogonal coordinates are range and cross range (azimuth). The amplitude and phase of the received signals are collected for the duration of an integration time after which the signal is processed. High range resolution is achieved by the use of wide bandwidth transmitted pulses. High azimuth resolution is achieved by focusing, with a signal processing technique, an extremely long antenna that is synthesized from the coherent phase history. The pulse repetition frequency of the SAR is constrained within bounds established by the geometry and signal ambiguity limits. SAR operation requires relative motion between radar and target. Nominal velocity values are assumed for signal processing and measurable deviations are used for error compensation. Residual uncertainties and high-order derivatives of the velocity which are difficult to compensate may cause image smearing, defocusing, and increased image sidelobes. The SAR transforms the ocean surface into numerous small cells, each with dimensions of range and azimuth resolution. An image of a cell can be produced provided the radar cross section of the cell is sufficiently large and the cell phase history is deterministic. Ocean waves evidently move sufficiently uniformly to produce SAR images which correlate well with optical photographs and visual observations. The relationship between SAR images and oceanic physical features is not completely understood, and more analyses and investigations are desired.},

These fields are close to those expected for perfectly conducting moons. We investigate the implications of these observations for the electrical structure of the moon's interiors using a simple shell model. It is found that Europa and Callisto must possess regions where the conductivity exceeds 0.06 and 0.02 S/m at a depth of less than 200 and 300 km below the surface, respectively. This conductivity is unattainable in ice or silicates, unless the ice layer is at least partially molten or very large temperature gradients can be maintained below the ice. An ionosphere or a cloud of pick-up ions are probably also insufficiently conductive. Global Earth-like oceans under the surface of both moons could account for the observations provided they are at least a few kilometers thick.},

The repetition rate (i.e., the ratio of number of events, when wave heights were greater than some fixed one, to record duration) and the intermittence coefficient (i.e., the ratio of the duration of oscillations larger than 5 m, to the record duration) have been calculated. The repetition rate was used to determine the predicted wave height, that is, the heights that can be surpassed only once. The prediction quality was estimated by analyzing a few waves with very large height observed during the experiment. The empirical formulas have been theoretically interpreted within the framework of the Poisson statistics. It allowed one to predict internal waves for various water regions.},

@article{Matthews2005,
abstract = {One of the unique features of the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) subsystem of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is the near-infrared back-looking view, which is obtained 55 s later than the corresponding nadir view. Although the stereoscopic capability derived from a combination of these two views was originally designed for use in land applications, serendipitous observation has shown that it also represents a promising source of data over water bodies. In fact, when coupled with surface temperature measurements derived from the sensor's thermal-infrared (TIR) component, stereo viewing forms a powerful observational capability that can be exploited in the monitoring of lake and marine environments. One important aspect introduced by the stereo system is the capability to measure the short-term displacements associated with surface currents and waves by comparing the nadir and back-looking views. In initial results presented here, surface motion was deduced from the displacement of a ship wake appearing in the Sun glitter regime of an ASTER image of the Izu Shoto islands, which lie to the southwest of Tokyo Bay, Japan. Within the natural limitations imposed by spatial and temporal resolutions, this measurement was found to be consistent with simultaneous surface current values derived from a nearby shore-based High-frequency (HF) radar system. The success of this basic comparison introduces the possibility that stereo imaging from space, if well tuned to follow the motion of surface slicks and other surface features within the Sun glitter regime, could provide a future means of observing surface current on a global scale.Data from the VNIR stereo system also highlights the influence of observational geometry. In the case of a surface with Sun glitter, this often manifests as a brightness reversal between the nadir and back-looking views in which relatively bright (dark) features at nadir appear dark (bright) in the back-looking view. Such a region of brightness reversal (ROBR) can be indicative of a locally rough or smooth surface texture as may be found, for example, in the vicinity of internal waves (rough) or ship wakes (smooth). Simple analysis based on a "Back to Nadir" ratio of relative radiances shows that the signal strengths measured by ASTER within a ROBR can yield a crude estimate of the mean square surface slope, which is an important parameter in theories of sea surface roughness imaging by devices such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).Several other potential applications of VNIR stereo data in coastal zone and lake monitoring are considered here, including the study of internal waves (in the Strait of Gibraltar), derivation of wind velocity at cloud height, swell-wave propagation, suspended sediment transport, marine traffic monitoring and ship wake patterns. As the reflectivity of water in the near infrared reverses from low to high in the presence of Sun glitter, most of the applications discussed here involve glitter and hence some discussion of the influence of sensor view geometry is presented. The general conclusion of the paper is that future missions such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), which aim to deploy high spatial resolution stereo viewing systems primarily for land applications, should also return data of considerable value in oceanography and limnology, particularly if their observational geometry can be adjusted to permit the imaging of Sun glitter from water surfaces.},

Internal waves become visible on SAR as well as on images acquired in the visible band because they are associated with sea surface roughness variations. In the past, spaceborne SAR imagery has been used extensively in studies of the dynamics of internal waves, but to a much lesser extent visible imagery has been used. In this paper we show that SPOT images acquired over the above mentioned ocean areas, where often cloudfree or partially cloudfree conditions are encountered, are also very useful in such studies. The similarities and differences in the internal wave signatures on SAR and optical imagery are discussed.},

We present a small sample of images. The spirals are broadly distributed over the world's oceans, 10-25 km in size and overwhelmingly cyclonic. Under light winds favourable to visualization, linear surface features with high surfactant density and low surface roughness are of common occurrence. The linear features are wound into spirals in vortices associated with horizontal shear instability, modified by rotation, in regions where the shear is comparable with the Coriolis frequency. Two models for concentrating shear are presented: a softened version of the classical sharp Margules front, and the time-dependent Lagrangian model of Hoskins \& Bretherton. Horizontal shear instabilities and both frontal models favour cyclonic shear and cyclonic spirals, but for different reasons.},

abstract = {We recall the simple statistical concept that non-Gaussian distribution peakedness results from the compounding of random processes. This idea is applied to observations and analysis of sea surface slopes as inferred using optical and microwave-scattering measurements. Our study emphasizes the importance of identifying and quantifying the distribution variance and kurtosis from observations. Data are shown to indicate consistently non-Gaussian peakedness, to indicate the need to report at least two parameters in an even order analysis, and to indicate near equivalence between radar and optical data. Physical interpretation for observed infrequent steep slopes is given via compounding statistical processes where normally distributed short-scale waves are modulated because of random fluctuations mainly associated with the underlying long wave field. Implications of non-Gaussian peakedness are provided for altimeter backscatter theory and for modeling wave-breaking probability.},

@article{Cox1954,
abstract = {A method is developed for interpreting the statistics of the suns glitter on the sea surface in terms of the statistics of the slope distribution. The method consists of two principal phases: (1) of identifying, from geometric considerations, any point on the surface with the particular slope required for the reflection of the suns rays toward the observer; and (2) of interpreting the average brightness of the sea surface in the vicinity of this point in terms of the frequency with which this particular slope occurs. The computation of the probability of large (and infrequent) slopes is limited by the disappearance of the glitter into a background consisting of (1) the sunlight scattered from particles beneath the sea surface, and (2) the skylight reflected by the sea surface.The method has been applied to aerial photographs taken under carefully chosen conditions in the Hawaiian area. Winds were measured from a vessel at the time and place of the aerial photographs, and cover a range from 1 to 14 m sec-1. The effect of surface slicks, laid by the vessel, are included in the study. A two-dimensional Gram-Charlier series is fitted to the data. As a first approximation the distribution is Gaussian and isotropic with respect to direction. The mean square slope (regardless of direction) increases linearly with the wind speed, reaching a value of (tan 16)2 for a wind speed of 14 m sec-1. The ratio of the up/downwind to the crosswind component of mean square slope varies from 1.0 to 1.9. There is some up/downwind skewness which increases with increasing wind speed. As a result the most probable slope at high winds is not zero but a few degrees, with the azimuth of ascent pointing downwind. The measured peakedness which is barely above the limit of observational error, is such as to make the probability of very large and very small slopes greater than Gaussian. The effect of oil slicks covering an area of one-quarter square mile is to reduce the mean square slopes by a factor of two or three, to eliminate skewness, but to leave peakedness unchanged.},

Spectrum analysis of the records made with an Admiralty wave analyser1 confirmed these findings.

abstract = {The paper describes the case 2 coastal water algorithm, which has been developed for the ground processor of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The spectrometer is operated on board the earth observation satellite ENVISAT of the European Space Agency ESA. The algorithm derives the inherent optical properties (IOP) (1) absorption coefficient of phytoplankton pigment, (2) absorption coefficient of gelbstoff and total suspended matter after bleaching the phytoplankton pigment fraction and (3) the scattering coefficient of total suspended matter (TSM). The IOPs of (1) and (3) are also converted into the concentrations of chlorophyll a and TSM dry weight. The algorithm is based on a neural network (NN), which relates the bi-directional water leaving radiance reflectances with these IOPs. The network is trained with simulated reflectances. The bio-optical model used for the simulations is based on a large data set collected mainly in European waters. One special feature is the combination of a forward NN and a backward NN, which allows testing if the measured spectrum is within the scope of the training set. The comparison with independent test data sets, in situ observations and with the case 1 water algorithm used for MERIS show a good agreement.},

Spectral bands for resolving solar-stimulated chlorophyll fluorescence and a split window in the 4-mu m region for SST will result in important new global ocean science products for biology and physics. MODIS will return full global data at 1-km resolution. The complete suite of Levels 2 and 3 ocean products is reviewed, and many areas where MODIS data are expected to make significant, new contributions to the enhanced understanding of the oceans' role in understanding climate change are discussed. In providing a highly complementary and consistent set of observations of terrestrial, atmospheric, and ocean observations, MODIS data will provide important new information on the interactions between earth's major components.},

Two assurance units incorporated by the algorithm are intended to flag pixels with inaccurate atmospheric correction and specific hydro-optical properties not covered by the applied hydro-optical model. The hydro-optical model is a set of spectral cross-sections of absorption and backscattering of the colour producing agents. The combination of the optimization procedure and a replaceable hydro-optical model makes the developed algorithm not specific to a particular satellite sensor or a water body. The algorithm performance efficiency is amply illustrated for SeaWiFS, MODIS and MERIS images over a variety of water bodies.},

abstract = {An analysis of radar observations in C band combined with models is proposed to study some of the ocean surface properties and their relation with the sea surface backscatter. The electromagnetic part of the models is of different kinds: composite Bragg model with or without including effect of wave breaking zones on the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS), geometrical optics approximation and small-slope approximation model. The surface description is based on the wave spectrum proposed by Kudryavtsev et al. (2003), but tests with the spectrum of Elfouhaily et al. (1997) are also discussed to assess our conclusions. The originality is to use not only the NRCS in HH and VV polarizations, but also their difference in linear units. First, we show that the upwind-to-downwind anisotropy of the radar signal cannot be explained entirely by the modulation of Bragg waves by longer surface waves, but that an additional nonpolarized contribution must be invoked to explain it, consistently with scattering from zones of enhanced roughness associated with breaking waves. Then, combining a composite model and observations in the two polarizations, we assess the contribution of the nonpolarized backscatter on the total NRCS. Finally, the proposed full model, which takes into account the nonpolarized contribution over breaking zones, gives good agreement with the observed polarization ratio and with the NRCS in each polarization.},

abstract = {The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was launched in December 1999 on the polar orbiting Terra spacecraft and since February 2000 has been acquiring daily global data in 36 spectral bands-29 with 1 km, five with 500 m, and two with 250 m nadir pixel dimensions. The Terra satellite has on-board exterior orientation (position and attitude) measurement systems designed to enable geolocation of MODIS data to approximately 150 m (1 Q) at nadir. A global network of ground control points is being used to determine biases and trends in the sensor orientation. Biases have been removed by updating models of the spacecraft and instrument orientation in the MODIS geolocation software several times since launch and have improved the MODIS geolocation to approximately 50 m (1sigma) at nadir. This paper overviews the geolocation approach, summarizes the first year of geolocation analysis, and overviews future work. The approach allows an operational characterization of the MODIS geolocation errors and enables individual MODIS observations to be geolocated to the sub-pixel accuracies required for terrestrial global change applications.

abstract = {Analysis of Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Aqua/Terra Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) infrared (IR) imagery of coastal upwelling in the southeastern Baltic Sea is presented. It is found that upwelling features are well distinct in the SAR images, and the leading imaging mechanism appears to be the change of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) stratification over the sea surface temperature (SST) front. This finding is supported by model calculations of the MABL transformation supplemented with the SAR backscatter calculations based on the CMOD4 model. In addition an empirical dependence of the SAR contrasts over the upwelling region on the wind speed and the SST drop is suggested. Finally, surface slicks accumulated in the sea surface current convergence zones generate additional distinct features in SAR imagery. This effect is interpreted within the framework of the coastal current circulation model based on analysis of the SST snapshot.},

Observed sun glitter brightness anomalies are converted using a transfer function determined from the smoothed shape of sun glitter brightness. The method is applied to MODIS and MERIS sun glitter imagery of natural oil seeps and the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The short-scale roughness variations in the presence of mineral oils slicks are consistently extracted and compared to variations associated with the biogenic slicks. In doing so, the wind speed dependency on the roughness anomalies is also considered. A comparison to normalized radar cross section (NRCS) anomalies taken from the corresponding high resolution ASAR images is performed, and similarities as well as differences are investigated. The results document significant benefit from the synergetic use of sun glitter and radar imagery for detection and monitoring of surface slicks.},

abstract = {Abstract The standard integral equation for the surface current is solved iterativcly to obtain an estimate of the surface current on a perfectly conducting randomly rough surface. The far-zone scattered fields and the backscattering coefficients for vertical, horizontal and cross-polarizations are then computed using this current estimate. The polarized backscattering coefficients are explicit functions of the surface parameters and reduce to the Kirchhoff solution in the high-frequency region and to the first-order perturbation solution in the low-frequency region. The cross-polarized scattering coefficient reduces to the second-order perturbation result in the low-frequency region and to zero in the high-frequency limit. A comparison is made with scattering measurements taken under laboratory conditions on a random surface with ka equal to 0-44 and kl equal to 3-25 ( l is the correlation length) It is found that better agreement is obtained with the current model than with the first-order perturbation model in predicting polarized scattering. It is also shown that the separation between VV and HH polarizations decreases gradually with frequency and approaches zero in the high-frequency limit},

abstract = {Abstract A small-slope approximation (SSA) is used for numerical calculations of a radar backscattering cross section of the ocean surface for both K u - and C-bands for various wind speeds and incident angles. Both the lowest order of the SSA and the one that includes the next-order correction to it are considered. The calculations were made by assuming the surface-height spectrum of Elfouhaily et al for fully developed seas. Empirical scattering models CMOD2-I3 and SASS-II are used for comparison. Theoretical calculations are in good overall agreement with the experimental data represented by the empirical models, with the exception of HH-polarization in the upwind direction. It was assumed that steep breaking waves are responsible for this effect, and the probability density function of large slopes was calculated based on this assumption. The logarithm of this function in the upwind direction can be approximated by a linear combination of wind speed and the appropriate slope. The resulting backscattering cross section for upwind, downwind and cross-wind directions, for winds ranging between 5 and 15 m s−1, and for both polarizations in both wave bands corresponds to experimental results within 1–2 dB accuracy.},

@article{Walker1996,
abstract = {In this study the surface features and the radar backscatter associated with breaking waves generated by a uniform flow past a stationary submerged hydrofoil were examined. The level of energy dissipation due to breaking was varied by changing the foil angle of attack. Time series of surface elevation profiles were obtained for the breaking crest region and the following waves. Radar backscatter (X-band) was also measured for an incidence angle of 45 degrees with the radar looking both upwave and downwave for HH and VV polarizations. These measurements were compared to model predictions of radar backscatter using the surface elevation data as inputs to the model. The breaking crest region exhibited the largest surface disturbances, as measured by the temporal variance of the surface elevation. The maximum in the variance was associated with large low-frequency disturbances in the `toe' region. Downstream-moving waves appear just ahead of the crest and, due primarily to interaction with the spatially varying current set up by the stationary wave, decrease in amplitude by an order of magnitude as they propagate downstream. These surface disturbances remain at a low level thereafter. A maximum radar cross-section per unit area of about 0.5 was observed near the breaking crest, for both HH and VV polarization in the upwave look direction. The maximum value for the upwave look direction was about twice as large as for the downwave look direction. Downstream of the breaking crest, the radar cross-section decreased rapidly and then leveled off, and an increasing difference between the VV and HH backscatter was observed as the overall backscatter level decreased. Near the second crest, there was a small increase in the height variance and in the radar cross-section. The surface-elevation measurements were used as inputs for a Bragg-scattering model and the expected radar backscatter was calculated. The variations in the observed radar cross-section downstream of the breaking crest are satisfactorily explained by the Bragg model when surface-tilt effects are taken into account. However, the backscatter from the breaking crest itself is not accurately predicted since, in this region, the small-scale surface roughness exceed the limits of validity for the Bragg model.},

abstract = {Multiscale composite models based on the Bragg theory are widely used to study the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) over the sea surface. However, these models are not able to correctly reproduce the NRCS in all configurations and wind wave conditions. We have developed a physical model that takes into account, not only the Bragg mechanism, but also the non-Bragg scattering mechanism associated with wave breaking. A single model was built to explain on the same physical basis both the background behavior of the NRCS and the wave radar Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at HH and VV polarization. The NRCS is assumed to be the sum of a Bragg part (two-scale model) and of a non-Bragg part. The description of the sea surface is based on the short wind wave spectrum (wavelength from few millimeters to few meters) developed by Kudryavtsev et al. [1999] and wave breaking statistics proposed by Phillips [1985] . We assume that non-Bragg scattering is supported by quasi-specular reflection from very rough wave breaking patterns and that the overall contribution is proportional to the white cap coverage of the surface. A comparison of the model NRCS with observations is presented. We show that neither pure Bragg nor composite Bragg model is able to reproduce observed feature of the sea surface NRCS in a wide range of radar frequencies, wind speeds, and incidence and azimuth angles. The introduction of the non-Bragg part in the model gives an improved agreement with observations. In Part 2, we extend the model to the wave radar MTF problem.},

In contrast to the Alpers and Hennings Bragg-based model, the new model incorporates the full ocean wave spectrum, utilizes Hughes' suggested spectral decay rate formula and contains no adjustable parameters. For typical ocean currents, the new model predicts realistic values for L-band cross section modulations and comparable L-band and X-band cross section modulations. These latter results are shown to be due to backscatter from ocean waves that are significantly longer than the Bragg resonant wave. By comparison the Bragg-based imaging model is shown to predict that X-band modulations will be at least one order of magnitude weaker than L-band modulations.},

abstract = {A synergetic approach for quantitative analysis of high-resolution ocean synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and imaging spectrometer data, including the infrared (IR) channels, is suggested. This approach first clearly demonstrates that sea surface roughness anomalies derived from Sun glitter imagery compare very well to SAR roughness anomalies. As further revealed using these fine-resolution (1 km) observations, the derived roughness anomaly fields are spatially correlated with sharp gradients of the sea surface temperature (SST) field. To quantitatively interpret SAR and optical (in visible and IR ranges) images, equations are derived to relate the surface roughness signatures to the upper ocean flow characteristics. As developed, a direct link between surface observations and divergence of the sea surface current field is anticipated. From these satellite observations, intense cross-frontal dynamics and vertical motions are then found to occur near sharp horizontal gradients of the SST field. As a plausible mechanism, it is suggested that interactions of the wind-driven upper layer with the quasi-geostrophic current field (via Ekman advective and mixing mechanisms) result in the generation of secondary ageostrophic circulation, producing convergence and divergence of the surface currents. The proposed synergetic approach combining SST, Sun glitter brightness, and radar backscatter anomalies, possibly augmented by other satellite data (e.g., altimetry, scatterometry, ocean color), can thus provide consistent and quantitative determination of the location and intensity of the surface current convergence/divergence (upwelling/downwelling). This, in turn, establishes an important step toward advances in the quantitative interpretation of the upper ocean dynamics from their two-dimensional satellite surface expressions.},

abstract = {A method for retrieval of the spatial variations of the sea surface mean square slope (MSS) in sun glitter imagery, retrieved from satellite optical scanners is proposed. Under the proposed algorithm, reconstruction of the MSS spatial variations by measured sun glitter brightness contrasts is done with use of a transfer function which could be determined empirically – by the averaged shape of sun glint, as sure as theoretically – by a priori given sea surface slope probability distribution model. Developed method is applied for quantitative analysis of the oil spill surface manifestations in the Gulf of Mexico and internal waves (IWs) surface manifestations near the Amazon River mouth. Results of the analysis have demonstrated highly feasible approach for investigation of surface manifestations of arbitrary origin ocean phenomena.},

@article{Barrick1972,
abstract = {Scatter from the sea near grazing from MF through VHF is analyzed in this paper. Results based on the compensation theorem show that the dependence upon the grazing angles, as well as upon frequency, range, and the effective surface impedance, can be removed for vertical polarization as the familiar ''Norton attenuation factors.'' Time variation of the surface is included, and results are derived for both the average received power and its spectral density. The first-order dispersion relationship for gravity waves is used to show that the received spectrum from a patch of sea consists of two discrete Doppler shifts above and below the carrier, predictable from simple Bragg diffraction considerations. Using the Phillips wind-wave model as an upper limit for wave heights, estimates sigma0 (radar cross section per unit area) of -17 dB are obtained near grazing. Both the magnitude of sigmavv0 predicted from theory and the nature of the received spectrum are compared with measurements and the agreement supports the theory on both counts. Finally, the use of MF/HF radars for measuring sea state is suggested and discussed.},

abstract = {From observations of wind and of water surface elevation at 14 wave staffs in an array in Lake Ontario and in a large laboratory tank, the directional spectrum of wind-generated waves on deep water is determined by using a modification of Barber's (1963) method. Systematic investigations reveal the following: (a) the frequency spectrum in the rear face is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the frequency $\omega$ , with the equilibrium range parameter and the peak enhancement factor clearly dependent on the ratio of wind speed to peak wave speed; (b) the angular spreading $\theta$ of the wave energy is of the form sech2 ($\beta$ $\theta$ where $\beta$ is a function of frequency relative to the peak; (c) depending on the gradient of the fetch, the direction of the waves at the spectral peak may differ from the mean wind direction by up to 50 degrees, but this observed difference is predictable by a similarity analysis; (d) under conditions of strong wind forcing, significant effects on the phase velocity caused by amplitude dispersion and the presence of bound harmonics are clearly observed and are in accordance with the Stokes theory, whereas (e) the waves under natural wind conditions show amplitude dispersion, but bound harmonics are too weak to be detected among the background of free waves.},

@article{ncep,
abstract = {{Abstract The Climate Forecast System (CFS), the fully coupled ocean?land?atmosphere dynamical seasonal prediction system, which became operational at NCEP in August 2004, is described and evaluated in this paper. The CFS provides important advances in operational seasonal prediction on a number of fronts. For the first time in the history of U.S. operational seasonal prediction, a dynamical modeling system has demonstrated a level of skill in forecasting U.S. surface temperature and precipitation that is comparable to the skill of the statistical methods used by the NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). This represents a significant improvement over the previous dynamical modeling system used at NCEP. Furthermore, the skill provided by the CFS spatially and temporally complements the skill provided by the statistical tools. The availability of a dynamical modeling tool with demonstrated skill should result in overall improvement in the operational seasonal forecasts produced by CPC. The atmospheric component of the CFS is a lower-resolution version of the Global Forecast System (GFS) that was the operational global weather prediction model at NCEP during 2003. The ocean component is the GFDL Modular Ocean Model version 3 (MOM3). There are several important improvements inherent in the new CFS relative to the previous dynamical forecast system. These include (i) the atmosphere?ocean coupling spans almost all of the globe (as opposed to the tropical Pacific only); (ii) the CFS is a fully coupled modeling system with no flux correction (as opposed to the previous uncoupled ?tier-2? system, which employed multiple bias and flux corrections); and (iii) a set of fully coupled retrospective forecasts covering a 24-yr period (1981?2004), with 15 forecasts per calendar month out to nine months into the future, have been produced with the CFS. These 24 years of fully coupled retrospective forecasts are of paramount importance to the proper calibration (bias correction) of subsequent operational seasonal forecasts. They provide a meaningful a priori estimate of model skill that is critical in determining the utility of the real-time dynamical forecast in the operational framework. The retrospective dataset also provides a wealth of information for researchers to study interactive atmosphere?land?ocean processes.}},

Here we assess the improvement in composite global observations and the feasibility of producing high resolution blended sea winds. The number of the long-term US sea surface wind speed observing satellites has increased from one in July 1987 to five or more since 2000. Global 0.25 degrees gridded, blended products with temporal resolutions of 6-hours, 12-hours and daily have become feasible since mid 2002, mid 1995 and January 1991, respectively with 75\% time coverage and 90\% spatial coverage between 65 degrees S - 65 degrees N). If the coverage is relaxed, the feasible times can be extended to earlier periods. These statistics provide practical guidance to produce reliable blended products for different applications, and serve as guidance on the design of future global observing systems.},
